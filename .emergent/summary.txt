**User's preferred language**: The user's primary language is **French (fr)**. The next agent MUST respond in French only.

**what currently exists?**
A full-stack application with a React frontend and FastAPI backend.
-   **Backend**: Manages NSL-KDD data processing, trains ML models (Random Forest, Decision Tree), and serves data via API endpoints. It includes a new real-time traffic monitoring system to support the DoS attack simulation page.
-   **Frontend**: Has undergone a complete visual overhaul to a Cyber-Tactical theme. It features a dark UI, neon accents, glitch effects, animated backgrounds with particles, and a 3D interactive globe on the homepage.
-   **Pages**:
    *   : Homepage with a 3D globe and key stats.
    *   : Visualizations of the dataset.
    *   : Model performance metrics.
    *   : Interface for live predictions.
    *   : A new page that shows real-time traffic, detects simulated DoS attacks, and displays alerts and logs.
-   **Key Fixes**: The previously reported z-index bug with chart modals has been fixed using React Portals. The sidebar navigation bug (disappearing on click) has also been resolved.

**Last working item**:
*   **Last item agent was working**: The user requested a fix for the disappearing navigation bar, pointed out that some elements were not visible, and asked for a more animated and visually stunning design with additional 3D elements. The agent successfully fixed the navigation bar and implemented a major UI enhancement pass, adding animated borders, glitch effects, and background particles.
*   **Status**: **USER VERIFICATION PENDING**
*   **Agent Testing Done**: Y (via multiple screenshots of all pages)
*   **Which testing method agent to use?**: Manual testing by user is the next step. If UI issues persist, use the **screenshot tool** to verify specific elements reported by the user.
*   **User Testing Done**: N

**All Pending/In progress Issue list**:
*   Issue 1: Some UI elements are not visible (P0)

**Issues Detail**:
*   **Issue 1: Some UI elements are not visible (P0)**
    *   **Description**: In the last user request, they mentioned ...fix some elemenets that are not visibible.... The agent proceeded with a broad UI enhancement but did not get specific details on which elements were affected. This could be a styling, layout, or responsiveness issue.
    *   **Attempted fixes**: The agent performed a major UI overhaul which might have inadvertently fixed the issue, but this is unconfirmed.
    *   **Next debug checklist**:
        1.  Ask the user to specify which elements are not visible and on which pages.
        2.  Request a screenshot from the user if possible.
        3.  Inspect the CSS and component structure for the reported elements (e.g., check for incorrect , , , or color contrast issues).
        4.  Verify the layout on different screen sizes to check for responsiveness problems.
    *   **Why fix this issue and what will be achieved with the fix?**: This is critical to ensuring the website is perfect for the user's presentation.
    *   **Status**: **NOT STARTED** (requires user clarification)
    *   **Is recurring issue?**: N
    *   **Should Test frontend/backend/both after fix?**: Frontend
    *   **Blocked on other issue**: User feedback.

**In progress Task List**:
*   Task 1: Enhance website design and interactivity (P1)

**Task Detail**:
*   **Task 1: Enhance website design and interactivity (P1)**
    *   **Where to resume**: The user requested ...more 3d and make the website more animated with better stunning design.... The agent has already delivered a significant upgrade. The next step is to present the current design to the user, get their feedback on the recent changes, and ask for specific ideas for further 3D or animated elements they would like to see.
    *   **What will be achieved with this?**: Fulfills the user's core requirement for a visually impressive presentation website.
    *   **Status**: **IN PROGRESS**

**Code Architecture**


**Key Technical Concepts**
-   **Frontend**: React, React Router, Recharts, **React Three Fiber / Three.js** (for 3D graphics)
-   **Backend**: FastAPI (Python), Scikit-learn, Pandas
-   **Styling**: Custom CSS with animations, pseudo-elements, glitch effects, and a neon color palette.

**key DB schema**
-   No changes. The application remains primarily file-based, using the NSL-KDD dataset loaded in memory. MongoDB is configured but not central to the current features.

**All files of reference**
-   : Completely rewritten to support the new design, persistent sidebar, and routing.
-   : New file containing the UI and logic for the real-time attack monitor.
-   : New component for the 3D animated globe on the homepage.
-   : Heavily modified with new CSS variables, animations, and styles for the Cyber-Tactical theme.
-   : Extended with a request-tracking middleware and API endpoints (, ) for the live monitoring feature.

**Areas that need refactoring**:
- The user mentioned some elements are not visibible. An investigation is needed to identify and refactor the responsible components/CSS.

**key api endpoints**
-    (GET): Returns the current traffic status (requests/sec, attack state).
-    (POST): An endpoint to be hit by the DoS simulation to generate traffic.
- All previous endpoints for EDA, model metrics, and prediction remain active.

**Critical Info for New Agent**
-   **Aesthetics are the Top Priority**: The user's main goal is a visually stunning website for a presentation. Prioritize UI/UX polish, animations, and wow-factor.
-   **Clarify Subjective Requests**: The user's requests for more 3D or better design are open-ended. Before implementing, propose specific changes (e.g., I can add an animated 3D model of a data packet, would you like that?) and get user approval.
-   **Address Invisibility Issue First**: Before adding new features, you must ask the user to clarify which elements are not visible. This is a potential bug that needs to be resolved.
-   **Jupyter Notebook is Still Pending**: Do not forget the pending task to refine the Jupyter notebook's content and style.
